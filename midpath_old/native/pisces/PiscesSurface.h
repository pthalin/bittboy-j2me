//Color models - supported surfaces 
/** 
 * @defgroup SurfaceTypes Surface types supported in PISCES
 * Surface type. There are many color models used in computer graphics. This is
 * because of finite color count, that can be displayed on different graphic-
 * cards/displays.    
 * 
 * @def TYPE_INT_RGB
 * @ingroup SurfaceTypes 
 * Surface type TYPE_INT_RGB. There is one byte for every
 * RGB component. Data are stored in array of int. There is no native alpha
 * support in this model.
 * @def TYPE_INT_ARGB
 * @ingroup SurfaceTypes
 * Surface type TYPE_INT_ARGB. There is one byte for every RGB component and 
 * alpha. Data are stored in array of int.   
 * @def TYPE_INT_ARGB_PRE
 * @ingroup SurfaceTypes 
 * Surface type TYPE_INT_ARGB_PRE. Every color component is premultiplied by its
 * alpha value. Four bytes are used to store one pixel value.
 * @def TYPE_USHORT_565_RGB
 * @ingroup SurfaceTypes 
 * Surface type TYPE_USHORT_565_RGB. This color model uses 2 bytes to store
 * RGB color. 5bits for Red and Blue component and 6 bits for Green component.
 * We use unsigned short array to store the data.
 * @def TYPE_BYTE_GRAY
 * @ingroup SurfaceTypes 
 * Surface type TYPE_BYTE_GRAY. This color model uses 256 grades of shade to
 * view data. We use one byte to represent one pixel.
